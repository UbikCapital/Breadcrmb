Breadcrmb DApp 

#Service Description:

Breadcrmb is a mobile DApp built on iOS. Many apps today store your location data and location check-ins on a 3rd party server, selling your data to advertisers. A large number of individuals continue to use these apps due to limited alternatives. We believe individuals should own their own data and that's why we created Breadcrmb. With Breadcrmb, users can check-in at locations around the world and own their own data! All of the user data is stored locally on their phone, only leaving to securely upload it to the ICON Blockchain, using the user's own password protected keys generated securely using Official ICON SDKs. Thus, users own their data, no one else! By uploading their data to the blockchain, it is obscured by the key and not directly tied to the user, their phone number, or your device. Users can interact with the data using their ICON keys in a secure manner. Lastly, by using the ICON network, users can rest assured that their data will not be tampered with and will be accessible anytime from now and into the future! If enough people stop giving their location data away freely to 3rd parties and take control of their data, we envision an environment in which users could actually sell their data to advertisers in the future, should they wish to do so.
In addition to checking in at all of the neat places users choose to visit, Breadcrmb also enables them to rate these places securely on the ICON Blockchain, leaving a memento of what that place meant to them!
While the ICON fees are relatively efficient, we've gone a step further and are the first DApp to integrate ICON's new Fee 2.0! With Fee 2.0, users just deposit a minimal amount of ICX and then we as the SCORE operator pay the usage fees! This allows users to use the ICON network in a seamless and transparent manner and we hope it will increase usage of Breadcrmb. Fee 2.0 is optional to opt-in* and anyone can use the DApp without Fee 2.0, using their own ICX.

*(Note: Fee 2.0 is a very new feature of ICON and we have implemented a KYC program for this feature, as described in Breadcrmb. If you wish to opt-in, please follow the instructions and we will review your application. Due to Fee 2.0 being a new feature of the ICON blockchain, we are initially using a conservative approach in approving applications for whitelisting. We will review multiple applications and approve in batches, adding ICX for virtual step at time of approval. Please be patient.)
